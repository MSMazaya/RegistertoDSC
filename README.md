<h2>My personal opinion about flutter</h2>
<hr>
<p>Hello, i am currently using flutter for about 2 weeks and i feel its a very powerfull tools to
  create a great UI for <b>mobile apps</b>. but i need to emphasize the toughness to use flutter to
  do web app development. My first flutter based project is to create a simple linktree web (fun fact: 
  i recently switches computer, and the only project i dont back up is this one haha, since the code looks 
  terribly unorganized but if you want to check it just <a href="https://linktree-trial.web.app/">click here!</a>  
  It gives me first impression of "what such a complicated way to build a simple UI" because everything is a
  widget and im not used to organize widget on files. But right after jumps into a mobile app development,
  i'm super amazed by how powerfull it is. But still haha, i have much of my time struggling on organizing
  widgets. I really need a help and mentor on doing this, i need someone to teaches me about using firebase
  as my backend and etc. Super excited to be a part of DSC!. A</p>
