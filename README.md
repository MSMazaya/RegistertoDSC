<h2>My personal opinion about flutter</h2>
<hr>
<p>Hello, i am currently using flutter for about 2 weeks and i feel its a very powerfull tools to
  create a great UI for <b>mobile apps</b>. but i need to emphasize the toughness to use flutter to
  do web app development. My first flutter based project is to create a simple linktree web. It gives
  me first impression of "what such a complicated way to build a simple UI" because everything is a
  widget and im not used to organize widget on files. But right after jumps into a mobile app development,
  i'm super amazed by how powerfull it is.</p>
